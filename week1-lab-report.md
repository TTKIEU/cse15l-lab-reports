## Accessing my CSE15L account
[UCSD Account LookUp](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
I clicked the link above and entering in my credentials and scrolling down till I saw "_Addition Accounts_" with my CSE15L username boxed. I was then prompted to change my password through the "_Global Password Change_". After choosing a password for my account, I made sure to only change my password for the CSE15L account specifically.

## Logging in through a terminal
I already had VSC installed but in the chance that you don't, goto the [Visual Studio Code Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the instructions to install it. If you don't want to install it, just use your computer's built in terminal, it works the same. I'm working on a macbook so I didn't have to install git or git bash. Now to actually log in, open your terminal and enter 
>ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
replacing zz with my own CSE15L. After, I was prompted to enter in the password that I reset back when I was accessing my account credentials.
